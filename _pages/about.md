I am a Research Scientist in the [Mosaic](https://mosaic.allenai.org/) working with [Yejin Choi](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~yejin/) and the team at the [Allen Institute of AI](https://allenai.org/). Prior to this, I completed my Ph.D. from [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/) on grounded multimodal long-form generation from the [Language Technologies Institute](https://lti.cs.cmu.edu/) advised by [Alan W. Black](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~awb/) and [Yonatan Bisk](https://yonatanbisk.com/). My current focus is centered on three primary pillars:

* **Science of LMs:** Improving reliability and awareness in LLMs and VLMs with a focus on reducing hallucinations.
* **Multimodal distillation:** Syngergizing LLMs and VLMs to assist each other.
* **Interactive Agents for reasoning and generation:** Teaching machines to plan and execute in complex interactive tasks.

I am also excited about ***inference time algorithms***, ***multilinguality*** and ***alignment***. Get in touch if you want to chat, I'm open to collaborations or brainstorming!

I am fortunate to have been selected as a [Rising Star by UC Berkeley](https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/risingstars/2020/participants/chandu.shtml). I am very passionate about DEI and co-chaired Academic Inclusion sub-committee multiple years at [ACL 2020](https://acl2020.org/committees/diversity-inclusion), [ACL 2021](https://2021.aclweb.org/organization/committee/), [NAACL 2022](https://2022.naacl.org/committees/diversity-inclusion/) and co-organized [Widening NLP](https://www.winlp.org/) in 2020 and 2021. 
I am very active in participating in community activities, organized several *CL workshops at conferences and served as Area Chair at AACL 2023. I am fortunate to have worked with amazing researchers in my past internships at Google, Apple and Meta.
